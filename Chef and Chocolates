The first and only line of each test case contains three integers XX, YY and ZZ — the number of 5 rupee coins, the number of 10 rupee coins and the cost of each chocolate.
Output Format
For each test case, output the maximum number of chocolates that Chef can buy for Chefina.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 1001≤T≤100
1 \leq X,Y,Z \leq 10001≤X,Y,Z≤1000

Solution

#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	// your code goes here
int t,tot,choco,x,y,z;
	scanf("%d",&t);
	while(t--)
	{
	    scanf("%d%d%d",&x,&y,&z);
	    tot=5*x+10*y;
	    choco= tot/z;
	    printf("%d\n",choco);
	}
	return 0;
}
